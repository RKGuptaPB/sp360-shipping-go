        \ all details from the shipmentId mentioned in the path parameter and would\
        \ swap the address and create return label. However, for UPS `specialServices`\
        \ object is required as carrier mandates to provide package description with\
        \ PRL special service. <br> 2. User can customize the request by passing `fromAddress`,\
        \ `toAddress`, `parcelType`, `serviceId` in the request itself. <br> Please\
        \ Note that for UPS it is required to pass `specialServices` object with `PRL`\
        \ service id and  input parameters with name as `RETURN_PKG_DESCRIPTION`.\
        \ <br> For FedEx `specialServices` object is not required and PRL is added\
        \ by default while creating return.  If user wishes to provide RMA number,\
        \ it can be passed in `specialServices` object in the request body. <br> Please\
